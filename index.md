# Connectivity for the New Normal

[Site-Walk.org](https://site-walk.org) was created to bridge the gap COVID-19 has created for the construction management industry as a whole. 

Success of any project depends on the ability of experts to *observe site conditions* and see the overall progress while it is happening. This important function has been severely limited due to the current pandemic.

### Technology to the Rescue!

Through the use of clever technology and innovation we can still deliver a quality product while following safe practices like social distancing.
