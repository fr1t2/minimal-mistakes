# Connectivity for the New Normal

[Site-Walk.org](https://site-walk.org) was created to bridge the gap COVID-19 has created for the construction management industry as a whole. 

Success of any project depends on the ability of experts to *observe site conditions* and see the overall progress while it is happening. This important function has been severely limited due to the current pandemic.

### Technology to the rescue!

Through the use of clever technology and innovation we can still deliver a quality product while following safe practices like social distancing. 

* h264 Streaming Hardware providing connection from the site
* Quality video equipment for stable livestreams
* Streaming software and connectivity allowing multiple "Work From Home" users to join

By bridging this into an existing platform like **Zoom** or **MS Teams** we can take an entire meeting on-site to discuss any feature of work needed!

> This system is in BETA testing, please excuse any technical difficulties you may face and report any funny business to [issues@site-walk.org](mailto:issues@site-walk.org)

## Concourse Expansion

The first trial of this service is for the Concourse Expansion Program Denver International Airport is undergoing.
