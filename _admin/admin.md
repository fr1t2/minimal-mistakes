Streams can be managed below through the links to the [Restreamer server](https://github.com/datarhei/restreamer). New streams cannot be created here, for that you must contact the [admin](mailto:james@site-walk.org) 

> You must ensure that the stream is started and is listening. 

*(Error: Your stream wasn't accessible. .... Operation not permitted)*

## Setup


Each stream uses a seprate port to communicate with the video signal stream. Use the configuration details from below to connect the camera system to the server to stream.
