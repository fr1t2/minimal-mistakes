This site was created to facilitate coordination between those who are now working remotely due to covid-19 and the on-going progress that is construction. The feeds here are scheduled and coordinated through the DEN Program Management Team for the Concourse Expansion Program.

With love from the PMT, hoping this helps move the project forward!


## Challenges

Construction is inherently difficult to coordinate. Between design teams, engineers/architects, contractors, and all of the various stakeholders, keeping everyone on the same page is nearly impossible. Now we add the complications and challenges that COVID-19 has forced us all into. The majority of the design and management team is now working from home entirely, relying on virtual meeting services. 

These services work well for getting people together, however when we all need to see the installation on-site we hit a wall. Either the connections are poor from the site, or the service will not allow direct streaming that is quality.


##

The team is using a few tools to facilitate this system. The most difficult part of the stream from a remote location is the connectivity. Additionally the added benefit of having the entire team on the same page, as if they were all onsite.
